Facial Expression Recognition

The system works on convolutional neural network for extracting the signals and making a prediction. 
The model is first trained on Facial Expression Recognition Dataset from Kaggle using a pre-trained network VGG19. 
Next, Opencv is used to use camera and obtain live  Facial Expression predictions with confidence given by Confusion Matrix.
